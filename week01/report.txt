#Judith Rembang Katikana Cholya
In week 01 we were given more task about accessing badak server
So far I've learned how to clone git repository by using command "git clone my_link"
And then I learned how to see the list of all the files in the folder by using command "ls -al"
I also learned how to create folder by using command "mkdir <folder_name1> <folder_name2> ..."
After that there's this command to change the directory "cd dir_name"
And then creating file from nothingness by using command "touch filename"
Going back to the previous directory by using command "cd .."
And I excitedly learned how to push and pull into github repository
I also learned that there's various text editor that I can use such as vi, vim, and nano. I tried using nano at first but then I think I'm more familiar with vi since I've been using this before.
And then we learned about CLI. Actually I still have a blurry understanding about this one but I'll keep on learning.
Oh and I found out that we could verify our current directory by using the "pwd" command
The last part about week01 is "intro to scripting" and I'm kinda afraid so..
Let's keep on moving
