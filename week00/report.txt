Task 0 - Week Zero Requirement
In week 0 we were given a task, described in a series of steps that we need to follow
First of all we all must have a google acount, or create one if we don't have one
Next, we must have a github account, or create one if we don't have one
And then, we have to create a repository named os171 on our github account
After that, we have to fill out a form provided by login to our google account first
After finishing all of the steps above, we need to wait for 24 hours
And then check our submission status
We need to check on some link provided to know whether our registration is processed correctly or got an error
After we were registered we need to log in to badak.cs.ui.ac.id
